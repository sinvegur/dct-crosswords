# Cursor Tasks

Task queue for handing work from Claude (planning/review) to Cursor (implementation) on dct-crosswords.

## Protocol

- **Cursor**: when told "new task for you, check TASKS.md", find the topmost entry marked `[TODO]`. Implement only that task — don't start a second `[TODO]` in the same pass. When finished, change its status to `[READY FOR REVIEW]` and add a short "Implementation notes" line under it if anything deviated from the instructions.
- **Claude**: reviews `[READY FOR REVIEW]` entries against the actual diff. Marks `[DONE]`, **commits immediately** (one task = one commit, task ID in the subject line), and deletes the entry (git history keeps the record — no need to accumulate finished tasks here). Or marks `[CHANGES REQUESTED]` and appends specific notes for Cursor to address, leaving status as `[CHANGES REQUESTED]` until fixed.
- IDs are sequential (T001, T002, ...) and never reused, even if a task is deleted.
- Only one task should be active (`[TODO]` at the top) at a time, to keep diffs small and reviewable.
- **Only make the changes the task explicitly describes.** If you notice something else worth fixing while working, do NOT implement it — note it in "Implementation notes" as a suggestion and let Claude turn it into its own task. This has been raised twice already (T001 favicon/port, T002 layout rework) — a third occurrence means diffs will be rejected without detailed review.

## T011 — [BLOCKED, do not start yet] Remove the "Toggle (SPACE)" / "Direction (SPACE)" buttons; consolidate into small instructional text

**T010 is done, but this is deprioritized behind the T012/T013 backend work the user just started — wait for explicit go-ahead before picking this up, even once it's otherwise unblocked.**

Both `CrosswordPlayer.tsx` (button labeled "Toggle (SPACE)", in the ACROSS `directionHeader`) and `PuzzleDesigner.tsx` (button labeled "Direction (SPACE)", same location) have a button that just toggles direction — redundant with the SPACE key, which already does the same thing. Remove both buttons entirely and replace with small instructional text.

**1. Remove both buttons.**

**2. Add one small instructional line under "ACROSS"** (in the `directionHeader`, where the button used to sit) in both files, reading something like `"Toggle direction with SPACE"` — small/muted text (reuse `.subtle` or similar existing small-text styling), not a button.

**3. Clean up redundant existing copy** now that the instruction lives in one place:
   - `PuzzleDesigner.tsx`: the `.controlsRow` subtitle currently reads (Letter mode) `"Letter mode: type answers (Turkish uppercase). Toggle direction with SPACE."` — remove this line entirely for Letter mode (both the "type answers" part, which added no value, and the "toggle direction" part, now covered by the new text under ACROSS). Leave the Block mode text (`"Block mode: click cells to toggle white ↔ black."`) unchanged — that's a different, still-useful instruction.
   - `CrosswordPlayer.tsx`: the subtitle near the puzzle title currently reads `` "Click a cell, type letters (Turkish uppercase). Toggle direction with `SPACE`." `` (note: has stray literal backtick characters around SPACE in the current text — clean those up too as part of touching this line). Remove this subtitle entirely, or shorten it to just `"Click a cell, type letters (Turkish uppercase)."` without the direction part (your call which reads better) — the direction instruction itself should only live in the one new spot under ACROSS.

**4. Compensate for the removed button — don't regress touch/mouse-only users.** Right now SPACE and the button are the *only* two ways to toggle direction; without a keyboard, a user sitting on a cell that starts both an across and down entry has no way to switch to the other direction without the button (clicking the same already-active cell currently just re-confirms the same direction, doesn't toggle). Fix: make clicking an **already-selected/active** cell toggle direction (if that cell belongs to both an across and a down entry) — standard crossword-app pattern. Implement this in both `CrosswordPlayer.tsx` (`handlePickCell`) and `PuzzleDesigner.tsx` (`pickCell`): if the clicked cell is already the active cell, and it has an entry in the *other* direction available, toggle to that direction instead of re-selecting the same one.

Scope: `CrosswordPlayer.tsx`, `PuzzleDesigner.tsx` only.

## T021 — [READY FOR REVIEW] "Autofill" button in the designer, for fast test/preview publishing

**Motivation:** creating a publishable puzzle currently requires manually filling every single letter and clue — real, tedious friction for testing the publish flow, URL generation, share modal, etc., not just for building a real puzzle. Add a quick way to skip straight to "publishable" for testing purposes.

**1.** Add a button (e.g. "Autofill" or "Fill with test data") in `PuzzleDesigner.tsx`, placed near the Save draft/Publish buttons.

**2.** On click, fill in **only the currently-blank parts** — don't overwrite letters or clues that already have real content, so this is safe to use on a puzzle you're partway through without losing work (this matters especially given T016's unsaved-changes guard exists specifically to protect in-progress edits — don't undermine that with a button that silently clobbers them):
   - Every open grid cell that's currently empty gets filled with a placeholder letter (doesn't need to spell real words — cycling through A-Z is fine, e.g. reuse the same simple approach as generating test data elsewhere in this project).
   - Every entry (across and down) whose clue is currently blank gets a placeholder clue (e.g. `"Test clue {number} {direction}"` or similar — doesn't need to be meaningful).

**3.** After autofilling, the puzzle should immediately satisfy `canPublish` (assuming a title is already set, or default to the existing "New puzzle" title if blank) — the point is to unblock clicking Publish immediately afterward, not to leave anything else incomplete.

**4.** This is a permanent, always-available convenience feature for the (single) creator, not a hidden dev-only flag — no need to gate it behind an environment check, this app has one trusted user.

Scope: `PuzzleDesigner.tsx` only (plus `styles.css` only if the button needs anything not already covered by existing button styles).
